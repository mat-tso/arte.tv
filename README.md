# Arte API visualiseur 

This website uses [arte.tv's](https://www.arte.tv/) open API to retreive the video metadatas.

Nothing is sent to the server and you can peek at the magic on github.

Pro tip: you can query multiple videos by separating them with , in the URL hash.

All modern browser are supported as well as Internet Explorer 11.

## TODO
- [ ] Update to ARTE API V2
- [ ] Handle errors from `XMLHTTPRequest` & link to the raw JSON on failure.
